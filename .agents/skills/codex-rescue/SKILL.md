# Codex Task Delegation + Double-Check

You are a **translator + executor + double-checker**. The user is
handing off an implementation task. Your job is to parse their messy
input, wrap the **verbatim** task text in standard prompt scaffolding,
let Codex do the work in the background, then review what changed. The
scaffolding gives the delegation official-grade structure (scope guards,
a verification loop) without ever rewriting the user's words.

The scaffolding is **adaptive**: rescue's task type is variable
(implement / debug / investigate), so you pick the prompt blocks that
fit the run instead of forcing one fixed template. You add blocks
*around* the user's text — you never rephrase it — and they approve the
result at Phase 1.5.

**Critical:** do NOT explore the repo before Codex runs. The point of
delegating is that Codex builds the context. Exploring first biases
your double-check and wastes turns.

## Execution Contract

**This contract overrides default exploration habits. Read it before Phase 1.**

| Phase | Allowed | Forbidden |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 ANALYZE | `test -f/-s/-d`, `git status --porcelain` (file names only, not contents), `echo`, `printf` | `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `git diff`, `git log -p`, `git show`, `git blame`, Read, Grep, Glob |
| 2 INVOKE | Bash for companion launch via stdin pipe (no positional!) | All source reads |
| 3 WAIT | `status --wait` loop (≤6 iterations, ≤24 min) | All source reads, manual polling, `ps`/`kill` |
| 4 DOUBLE-CHECK | `git diff` the changed files; Read ONLY files Codex touched or cited | Reading whole files "for context"; reading uncited files |
| 5 REPORT + SAVE | Write report file | n/a |

Unknown flags are silently joined into the **task prompt** by the
companion (`readTaskPrompt :613-619`). Phase 1 whitelist is the only
safety net.

---

## Phase 1: Analyze

You are a translator. Use LM intelligence, not regex tables.

**Whitelist for this skill:**
- `--write` (bool; default ON for implementation, OFF for read-only investigation) — **companion flag**, included in the Phase 2 invocation.
- `--model <slug>`, `--effort <level>` — **skill-level flags**, route through `scripts/apply-codex-config.py` (see Apply block below) and **never reach the companion**. The alias `spark` auto-expands to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`. The script validates effort against `{minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh}` (`none` is only valid for `plan_mode_reasoning_effort`) and additionally cross-checks against the requested model's `supported_reasoning_levels` from `~/.codex/models_cache.json` — out-of-set values still save but surface a warning so the user sees it. If the user gives an obviously wrong value (typo), prefer `AskUserQuestion` in Phase 1 over letting it propagate.
- `--resume-last` / `--resume` / `--fresh` — mutually exclusive companion flags. Passing resume + fresh triggers `Choose either --resume/--resume-last or --fresh.` (`:750`). If ANALYZE produces a conflict, `AskUserQuestion`; never forward both.
- `--no-preview` (bool) — skip Phase 1.5 draft review. For power users who trust the translation and want to skip the approval gate.

**Everything else in `$ARGUMENTS` is the task description**, which
becomes the `<task>` body — you wrap it in prompt blocks below (see
*Wrap the task in prompt blocks*). Translate it cleanly:

- **Meta-instructions addressed to YOU** (e.g. "answer in Korean", "don't read the repo first" — often typed in the user's own language) → obey for your own behavior, never include in the task prompt (they'd confuse Codex).
- **Junk, emoji** → drop.
- **Vague task** (e.g., just "fix it", "do something") → `AskUserQuestion` for clarification. Never explore the repo to guess intent.
- **Unknown flag** (e.g., `--foo`, `--background`, `--wait`) → `AskUserQuestion`. `--background` and `--wait` are not needed — Pattern B always uses `--background` internally. `--wait` on task is **silent prompt corruption**; we never accept it.
- **Ambiguous effort / model value** → `AskUserQuestion`.

### Apply model/effort (if either flag was provided)

Run before Phase 2 so the companion sees the new `config.toml`:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/apply-codex-config.py" \
  "<literal clean model from Phase 1 or empty>" \
  "<literal clean effort from Phase 1 or empty>"
```

Relay the `Model: ... | Effort: ...` stdout line verbatim; pass stderr advisories through. **config.toml is global** — the change affects every Codex invocation (Official plugin, direct CLI, every codex-advisor skill) until changed again. Flag that to the user when values changed.

If neither flag was provided, still call with two empty strings so the user sees the current values in the same format.

**Before Phase 2, also print the Parsed line:**

```
Parsed: task="implement login rate limiter", write=true, resume=(last)
```

Order: apply-codex-config.py output first, Parsed line second. (Model/effort already shown by the apply script — don't duplicate them in Parsed.)

For edge cases, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/companion-usage.md §7`.

### Wrap the task in prompt blocks

The cleaned task text is **not** sent bare. Wrap it in standard
scaffolding so the delegation carries the same structure verify/research
get — but keep the user's words **verbatim** inside `<task>` (no
summarizing, no rewording). You add blocks *around* their text; you
never rewrite it. That's the whole point: structure without distortion.

Pick the blocks by task type — `--write` is the signal. An
implementation or fix mutates the repo, so it needs scope + verification
guards; a read-only investigation needs grounding instead.

- **Always:** `<task>` — the approved task text, verbatim.
- **`--write` ON (implement / fix):** add `<completeness_contract>`, `<verification_loop>`, `<action_safety>`.
- **`--write` OFF (read-only investigation):** add `<completeness_contract>`, `<grounding_rules>`.

<!-- blocks copied from official gpt-5-4-prompting (prompt-blocks.md); re-sync if the official guide updates -->

Block bodies — copy exactly:

```xml
<completeness_contract>
Resolve the task fully before stopping.
Do not stop at the first plausible answer.
Check whether there are follow-on fixes, edge cases, or cleanup needed for a correct result.
</completeness_contract>

<verification_loop>
Before finalizing, verify the result against the task requirements and the changed files or tool outputs.
If a check fails, revise the answer instead of reporting the first draft.
</verification_loop>

<action_safety>
Keep changes tightly scoped to the stated task.
Avoid unrelated refactors, renames, or cleanup unless they are required for correctness.
Call out any risky or irreversible action before taking it.
</action_safety>

<grounding_rules>
Ground every claim in the provided context or your tool outputs.
Do not present inferences as facts.
If a point is a hypothesis, label it clearly.
</grounding_rules>
```

Assemble the wrapped prompt with `<task>` first, then the selected
blocks in the order listed. This wrapped XML — **not** the bare task
text — is what Phase 1.5 previews and Phase 2 writes to PROMPT_FILE.
Because wrapping happens here in Phase 1, it still applies when
`--no-preview` skips the preview gate.

---

## Phase 1.5: Draft Review

**Skip this phase entirely if `--no-preview` was parsed in Phase 1.**

Before sending anything to Codex, show the user exactly what will be
sent. The user approved the *intent* — now they approve the *prompt*.

### Display the draft

Show the **wrapped XML prompt** (everything that will go into
PROMPT_FILE) in a fenced code block, along with the companion flags that
will be used — `<task>` holds their verbatim text, surrounded by the
blocks selected in Phase 1.

````
**Prompt to send to Codex:**

```xml
<task>
<the approved task description from Phase 1 — verbatim, nothing added>
</task>

<completeness_contract>
Resolve the task fully before stopping.
Do not stop at the first plausible answer.
Check whether there are follow-on fixes, edge cases, or cleanup needed for a correct result.
</completeness_contract>

<verification_loop>
Before finalizing, verify the result against the task requirements and the changed files or tool outputs.
If a check fails, revise the answer instead of reporting the first draft.
</verification_loop>

<action_safety>
Keep changes tightly scoped to the stated task.
Avoid unrelated refactors, renames, or cleanup unless they are required for correctness.
Call out any risky or irreversible action before taking it.
</action_safety>
```

Flags: `--write` `--resume-last`
````

The example above shows the `--write` block set. For a read-only run,
swap `<verification_loop>` + `<action_safety>` for `<grounding_rules>`
(per the Phase 1 selection). The fenced block must contain the **exact
wrapped XML** that will be written to PROMPT_FILE — the user's text
verbatim inside `<task>`, no summarization, no rewording.

### Ask for approval

Use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once:

- Question: "This prompt will be sent to Codex task."
- Options:
  1. "Approve — execute as shown"
  2. "Needs changes"
  3. "Cancel"

### Handle the response

- **Approve** → proceed to Phase 2 with the displayed text.
- **Needs changes** → the user will describe what to change. Apply
  their edit to the draft, then re-display and re-ask. No loop
  limit — the user controls when to stop.
- **Cancel** → stop execution. Do not proceed to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Invoke (Pattern B — companion `--background` + stdin pipe)

`task --background` is honored by the companion (`:758-790` →
`enqueueBackgroundTask`). It returns a job payload immediately.

```bash
set -o pipefail
CODEX_COMPANION=$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-companion.sh") \
  || { echo "Official Codex plugin not found — run /codex-setup" >&2; exit 1; }

mkdir -p "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/tmp"
TS=$(date +%s%N)
PROMPT_FILE="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/tmp/rescue-prompt-${TS}.txt"
JOB_JSON_FILE="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/tmp/rescue-job-${TS}.json"
PRE_LIST="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/tmp/rescue-pre-${TS}.list"
PRE_SHA="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/tmp/rescue-pre-${TS}.sha"
echo "PROMPT_FILE=$PROMPT_FILE"
echo "JOB_JSON_FILE=$JOB_JSON_FILE"
echo "PRE_LIST=$PRE_LIST"
echo "PRE_SHA=$PRE_SHA"

# Snapshot current repo state — file names only, no contents
git status --porcelain > "$PRE_LIST" 2>/dev/null || true
git rev-parse HEAD > "$PRE_SHA"

# Write the approved WRAPPED prompt from Phase 1.5 — <task> with the
# user's verbatim text plus the Phase 1 blocks. With --no-preview the
# preview is skipped, but the wrapping is NOT: write the wrapped prompt
# assembled in Phase 1, never the bare task text.
cat > "$PROMPT_FILE" <<'EOF'
<literal approved wrapped XML prompt from Phase 1.5 (or the Phase 1 wrapped prompt if --no-preview)>
EOF

# Launch via stdin pipe. Each flag line below is optional — include only
# what Phase 1 parsed. Omit the entire line for flags not provided.
# --write: include for implementation (default ON); omit for read-only.
# Model/effort are NOT passed as companion flags — they were written to
#   config.toml by apply-codex-config.py in Phase 1 and the companion
#   picks them up from there.
# --resume-last/--resume/--fresh: mutually exclusive; omit if none.
# NEVER pass a positional arg — readTaskPrompt short-circuits on
# positionalPrompt (:619), silently dropping stdin.
cat "$PROMPT_FILE" | node "$CODEX_COMPANION" task --background --json \
  --write \
  --resume-last \
  > "$JOB_JSON_FILE" 2> "${JOB_JSON_FILE}.stderr" \
  || { echo "task launch failed:" >&2; cat "${JOB_JSON_FILE}.stderr" >&2; exit 1; }

# Capture jobId — use node (already a dependency)
JOB_ID=$(node -e 'const fs=require("fs");try{const j=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(process.argv[1],"utf8"));if(!j.jobId)throw new Error("no jobId");process.stdout.write(j.jobId);}catch(e){process.stderr.write("JOB_ID parse failed: "+e.message+"\n");process.exit(1);}' "$JOB_JSON_FILE") \
  || { echo "raw companion stdout:" >&2; cat "$JOB_JSON_FILE" >&2; exit 1; }
echo "JOB_ID=$JOB_ID"
```

Each flag line in the template is optional — include only what Phase 1
parsed. Replace `<literal ...>` values with the actual strings from
Phase 1. `--write` defaults to ON for implementation; omit for
read-only investigation.

Remember the literal `PROMPT_FILE`, `JOB_JSON_FILE`, `PRE_LIST`,
`PRE_SHA`, and `JOB_ID` values. Re-inject these as literal strings in
every subsequent Bash call — shell variables do not survive across calls.

---

## Phase 3: Wait (`status --wait` loop)

Each `status --wait` call blocks ≤4 min (under Bash 300s). Re-call on
timeout. **Cap total iterations at 6** (24 minutes).

```bash
# Repeat this call until status is "completed" or "failed", or cap hit.
node "$CODEX_COMPANION" status --wait "<literal JOB_ID>" \
  --timeout-ms 240000 --json
```

Inspect the returned JSON:

- `status === "completed"` → proceed to fetch result
- `status === "failed"` → categorize per §6, save failure report
- `waitTimedOut === true` and `status` still `queued`/`running` → re-call (iteration budget permitting)
- 6 iterations exhausted → `wait-timeout` (§6). Do NOT silently cancel; leave the job running. Show the user the JOB_ID and suggest `/codex:status <JOB_ID>` for manual follow-up.

Fetch the final result:

```bash
node "$CODEX_COMPANION" result "<literal JOB_ID>" --json
```

Full error table: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/companion-usage.md §6`.

Notable cases:

- `Task <id> is still running. Use /codex:status before continuing it.` → a previous task is still in flight. Show the user the active jobId and stop. Never silently cancel.
- `Stored job <id> is missing its task request payload.` → detached worker couldn't load the request. `recovery-impossible`. Save failure report.

---

## Phase 4: Double-check

Now — and **only now** — you may read the code.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/evaluation.md`.

### If Codex made code changes (`--write`)

```bash
git diff
git diff --stat
git status --porcelain
```

For each changed file:

1. **Read the diff**, then read only the relevant sections of the file.
2. **Evaluate:**
   - Does the change actually solve the task?
   - Correctness — any bugs introduced?
   - Scope — any files modified that shouldn't have been? Cross-check against the pre-snapshot file list.
   - Side effects — does it break something nearby?

### If Codex returned investigation results (read-only)

Apply the Peer AI Evaluation in `evaluation.md`:

- **Agree** — claim matches the code
- **Disagree** — claim contradicts the code, with evidence
- **Nuance** — real insight, but missing context
- **False Positive (hallucination)** — Codex cited a file / function /
  line that does **not exist** in the current source tree
- **Uncited** — no concrete citation. Surface as "verification
  deferred". Never invent citations.

---

## Phase 5: Report + save

```bash
mkdir -p "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/reviews"
```

**Success:** save to
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/reviews/rescue-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md` with:

- The task description
- Codex's output verbatim
- The diff (if any)
- Claude's per-finding / per-file evaluation
- Verdict: appropriate / has issues / needs rework
- **Do NOT auto-accept changes.** Present, wait for user.

**Failure:** save to
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/reviews/rescue-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-failed.md` with
the §6 error category and captured stderr.

Clean up temp files using literal paths:

```bash
rm -f "<literal PROMPT_FILE path>" "<literal JOB_JSON_FILE path>" "<literal JOB_JSON_FILE.stderr path>" \
      "<literal pre.list path>" "<literal pre.sha path>"
```

---

## Gotchas

- **`--model` / `--effort` go through `apply-codex-config.py`, not the companion.** config.toml becomes the single source of truth; routing keeps every codex-advisor skill identical, lets the value persist for the next session without re-typing, and is the only way to set `effort` for review/adversarial (whose `valueOptions = [base, scope, model, cwd]` does not include effort). `apply-codex-config.py` warns on out-of-set effort and on per-model unsupported levels but still writes — surface the warning to the user rather than swallowing it.
- **Never combine `--resume` / `--resume-last` with `--fresh`.** The companion rejects the combination (`:750`).
- **Never pass a positional argument with Pattern B's stdin pipe.** `readTaskPrompt` short-circuits on `positionalPrompt || readStdinIfPiped()` (`:619`); a positional silently drops the entire task description.
- **`--wait` on task is silent prompt corruption.** It becomes part of the task prompt body. ANALYZE must reject it.
- **Do NOT explore the repo in Phase 1.** The point of delegation is that Codex builds the context. Exploring biases the double-check.

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/companion-usage.md §10`.
