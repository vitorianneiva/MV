# Agent Extension Visual

Analyze agent extensions and generate self-contained HTML wiki reports (or inline markdown) with security audit and plugin profiles. Currently supports Claude Code plugins.

## Instructions

### Input Parsing

Determine the analysis target from the user's message:

1. Path contains `/` → **local path** (resolve relative to cwd)
2. Contains `github.com` or `https://` → **GitHub URL**
3. Other text → **installed plugin name** (search `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`)
4. Nothing specified → **current directory** (scan `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `plugins/`)

For GitHub URLs, support subpath patterns:
- `github.com/owner/repo` → clone entire repo
- `github.com/owner/repo/tree/branch/plugins/foo` → clone repo, analyze subpath only

### Language Detection

Determine the output language:

1. **Explicit language argument**: `--lang <code>` (e.g., `--lang ko`, `--lang fr`, `--lang zh`) → use that language. Any language code is valid
2. **User message text**: Detect the language of the message (excluding URL/path) and match it
   - Examples: Korean text → Korean, Japanese text → Japanese, "en español" → Spanish, "auf Deutsch" → German
3. **URL only with no other text**: Use AskUserQuestion to ask the user's preferred language

Pass the detected language to sub-agents and use it for Phase 5 report assembly.

### Analysis Mode Detection

Determine **what** to analyze:

| Mode | Trigger Keywords | Scope |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| `analyze` **(default)** | "analyze", "inspect", "report", "wiki", "document" | Full analysis and Plugin Profile |
| `security` | "security audit", "permission analysis" | Security only |
| `overview` | "overview", "summary" | Identity + inventory only |

### Output Format Detection

Determine **how** to present the result (independent of analysis mode):

| Format | Trigger | Applies to |
|--------|---------|------------|
| HTML **(default)** | Default for `analyze` mode | `analyze` only |
| Inline markdown | "--format md", "markdown", "md", "inline", "text" | `analyze` only |
| Inline markdown **(always)** | — | `security`, `overview` (too brief for HTML) |

### Intent Check

*Why: An analysis for potential users focuses on capabilities and compatibility; an analysis for security reviewers focuses on permissions and risk. The audience shapes emphasis across all report sections.*

If the user's message already conveys clear intent (e.g., "security audit", "is this plugin safe", or a specific analysis mode keyword), skip this step.

If the request is ambiguous (e.g., just a plugin path with no other context), use AskUserQuestion to ask up to 2 questions:

1. **Audience**: Who will read this? (yourself, your team, plugin marketplace reviewers)
2. **Focus**: Any specific concern? (security, architecture, compatibility, general overview)

Defaults:
- Audience: the user themselves (evaluating the plugin)
- Focus: balanced full analysis

Pass audience and focus context to the analysis and report generation phases.

### Workflow

#### Phase 1: Source Acquisition

- **Local path**: Verify directory exists, proceed directly
- **Installed plugin**: Search `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` for matching directory
- **GitHub URL**: Clone to `/tmp/plugin-visual-{dirname}`:
  1. Generate `{dirname}` — pick any 8-character hex string yourself (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`)
  2. Clone directly (no mkdir needed — git creates the target directory):
     ```
     Bash(gh repo clone {owner/repo} /tmp/plugin-visual-{dirname})
     ```
     This is the only Bash command needed for cloning. Do not add extra commands for saving state or generating random strings.
  For subpath URLs (`github.com/owner/repo/tree/branch/plugins/foo`):
  1. Extract `owner/repo` for cloning
  2. Extract the subpath after `/tree/{branch}/` (e.g., `plugins/foo`)
  3. Clone the full repo, then set the analysis target to the subpath within the clone
- **Current directory**: Use cwd

If source cannot be found, inform user and stop.

**Source context** — save for later phases (source links in report):

| Source type | `source_type` | `source_base` | `github_url` |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Local path | `local` | `{absolute-path}` | — |
| Installed plugin | `local` | `{cache-path}` | — |
| GitHub URL (root) | `github` | `/tmp/plugin-visual-{dirname}` | `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{branch}` |
| GitHub URL (subpath) | `github` | `/tmp/plugin-visual-{dirname}/{subpath}` | `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{branch}/{subpath}` |

When cloning a subpath URL (e.g., `github.com/owner/repo/tree/main/plugins/foo`), include the subpath in both `source_base` and `github_url` so that relative paths from the plugin root produce correct source links.

#### Phase 2: Discovery

*Why: Accurate component inventory prevents analysis agents from missing or hallucinating plugin components.*

Scan the target directory for all plugin components.

**Step 1**: Run 3 Glob calls in parallel (single message):

| # | Pattern | Captures |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | `**/*.md` | SKILL.md, agent .md, command .md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md |
| 2 | `**/*.json` | plugin.json, hooks.json, .mcp.json, .lsp.json, settings.json |
| 3 | `LICENSE*` | License files |

**Step 2**: If Glob results are sparse (< 5 files found), run additional Glob calls (never Bash):
```
Glob("*", path: {target-directory})
Glob("**/*", path: {target-directory})
```
Then run targeted Glob on discovered directories (e.g., `skills/**/*`, `agents/**/*`, `commands/**/*`).

**Step 3**: Classify results into component types:

| Component | Path pattern |
|-----------|-------------|
| Skill | `skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Skill auxiliary | `skills/*/*` (non-SKILL.md) |
| Agent | `agents/*.md` |
| Command | `commands/*.md` |
| Rule | `rules/*.md` or root-level `RULE.md` |
| Hook config | `hooks/hooks.json` or `hooks/*.json` |
| MCP config | `.mcp.json` |
| LSP config | `.lsp.json` |
| Config | `settings.json` (plugin root) |
| Plugin manifest | `**/plugin.json` |

Build a component inventory with counts and file lists.

**Step 4**: Determine platform from Glob results (no additional Glob calls needed).

Check the file list from Step 1 for platform-unique signals:

| Platform | Unique signals (any match → detected) |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` directory, `agents/*.md`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `.mcp.json` |
| **Codex** *(not yet supported)* | `.codex/` directory, `AGENTS.md`, `agents/*.toml` |

If no known platform is detected, ask the user:
"Could not detect the agent platform. Currently supported: Claude Code. Is this a Claude Code plugin?"

If Codex is detected, inform the user that Codex analysis is not yet supported.

Set `{platform}` variable for subsequent phases. Currently only `claude-code` is implemented.

#### Phase 3: Metadata Collection

*Why: Reading identity files here avoids duplicate reads inside sub-agents, saving tokens.*

Read identity files in a single message with parallel Read calls:

- `plugin.json` (or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — whichever Phase 2 found)
- `hooks/hooks.json` (only if found in Phase 2)

Existence of LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, tests/ is already known from Phase 2.

Do NOT read README.md, SKILL.md, agent.md, command.md, or hook script files.
Sub-agents read these files directly — the feature-architect reads README.md in its own analysis procedure. Reading them here wastes tokens through duplication.

Output for Phase 4: plugin identity + file path inventory + existence flags + language.

#### Phase 4: Parallel Analysis

*Why: Feature and security analysis are independent concerns — parallel execution halves wall-clock time.*

For `overview` mode, skip this phase — go directly to Phase 5.

For `analyze` and `security` modes, delegate to agents in parallel.

**Agent prompt**: Provide each agent with:
- Plugin identity (name, version, author, description — from plugin.json)
- Target directory path
- Component file paths grouped by type (from Phase 2 Glob)
- Output language
- Analysis mode
- Source context: `source_type`, `source_base`, `github_url` (if applicable) — so feature-architect can include relative paths that the orchestrator will later combine with source_base for links

**For `analyze` mode with large plugins (total components > 15)** — split feature-architect into batches.

Count total = skills + agents + commands. Split each type in half:

```
S = number of skills, A = number of agents, C = number of commands

Task(subagent_type: "vision-powers:feature-architect", prompt: {
  skills 1..ceil(S/2) + agents 1..ceil(A/2) + commands 1..ceil(C/2)
})
Task(subagent_type: "vision-powers:feature-architect", prompt: {
  skills ceil(S/2)+1..S + agents ceil(A/2)+1..A + commands ceil(C/2)+1..C + MCP + LSP
})
Task(subagent_type: "vision-powers:security-auditor", prompt: {all file paths})
```

MCP, LSP, hooks, and rules are lightweight — keep them in Batch 2 only.
All three tasks run in parallel. Merge feature-architect batch results before Phase 5.

**For `analyze` mode with standard plugins (total components <= 15)**:

```
Task(subagent_type: "vision-powers:feature-architect", prompt: {all file paths})
Task(subagent_type: "vision-powers:security-auditor", prompt: {all file paths})
```

**For `security` mode** — launch only security-auditor:

```
Task(subagent_type: "vision-powers:security-auditor", prompt: {all file paths})
```

#### Phase 4.5: Environment Fit Diagnosis (analyze mode only)

*Why: Even a well-built plugin can be wrong for the user's environment. This step catches conflicts, redundancies, and budget overruns before they cause confusion.*

Diagnose whether this plugin is a good fit for the user's current environment — not just "can it run?" but "should it be installed here?"

**Full procedure**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plugin-visual/references/platforms/claude-code/env-fit-diagnosis.md` for the detailed 5-step process covering:
1. Extract plugin characteristics from feature-architect output (including rules, CLAUDE.md @imports, bundle source)
2. Run the environment scan script (`env-fit-scan.js`) — collects installed plugins, skills, commands, hooks, MCP servers, context metrics
3. Perform eight diagnostic analyses:
   - **Via script data** (steps 3A-3E, 3H): installation status, dependency check, context budget, functional overlap, hook impact, component dependencies
   - **Via orchestrator** (steps 3C extras, 3F, 3G): rules context cost (from feature-architect's rules analysis), CLAUDE.md @import chain, scope impact analysis, bundle source detection (from Phase 1 source context and plugin cache inspection)
4. Determine overall verdict (RECOMMENDED / CONDITIONAL / REDUNDANT / CONFLICTING)
5. Build diagnosis data structure for Phase 5/5R (includes scope_impact, bundle_source, and enhanced context_budget with always-loaded/deferred breakdown)

The environment scan script provides baseline data:
```
Bash(node {plugin-root}/scripts/env-fit-scan.js --plugin-name {plugin-name})
```

The orchestrator then supplements with:
- **Rules context cost**: Count rules from feature-architect output, classify as always-loaded (no `paths:`) or on-demand (`paths:` present), estimate tokens as `file_size / 4`
- **Scope impact**: All marketplace plugins install globally; check for framework-specific hooks/MCP that may warrant per-project activation
- **Bundle source**: Determine from Phase 1 `source_type` (local/github) or plugin cache path patterns (marketplace/symlink)

Save the combined `environment_fit` data for Phase 5/5R. Omit empty categories.

#### Phase 5: Report Assembly (inline markdown)

For `security` mode, `overview` mode, or `analyze` mode with `--format md` — assemble inline markdown report:

Assemble the report using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plugin-visual/references/platforms/claude-code/report-template.md` format:

- **`overview` mode**: Identity + Component Inventory sections only
- **`security` mode**: Security-focused report with risk summary, permission matrix, findings
- **`analyze` mode (--format md)**: Full report with analysis, Environment Fit Diagnosis, Skill Design Quality, and Plugin Profile

For Plugin Profile and Skill Design Quality, apply criteria from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plugin-visual/references/platforms/claude-code/analysis-criteria.md`.
For risk levels, apply rules from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plugin-visual/references/platforms/claude-code/security-rules.md`.
Environment Fit Diagnosis is a standalone section between Feature Deep Dive and Usage (not part of Plugin Profile). Include the full diagnosis from Phase 4.5: verdict, context budget (200K/1M scenarios), installation status, dependency check, overlap/trigger findings, hook impact, component dependencies, and recommendations.
Skill Design Quality includes: skill category distribution, per-skill design assessment (description quality, progressive disclosure, gotchas, scripts, hooks, data persistence, maturity level), and improvement recommendations. This data comes from the feature-architect's Skill Design Quality output.

Output the report in the detected language, using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plugin-visual/references/platforms/claude-code/report-template.md` format.
Translate all section headers, labels, and descriptions to the target language.
Keep component names, file paths, and technical terms (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) untranslated.

Output the report directly to the user (inline markdown).

#### Phase 5R: HTML Report Generation (analyze mode — default format)

For `analyze` mode with HTML format (the default), write a self-contained HTML file yourself — `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`. No templates, no intermediate JSON, no agent chains.

**1. Determine output path**:

Default output path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/reports/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{plugin-name}-report.html`

Where:
- `{YYYY-MM-DD}` is today's date
- `{plugin-name}` is from plugin.json name field (or directory name if no plugin.json)

**Existing report check**: Before generating, use Glob to search for `*-{plugin-name}-report.html` in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/reports/`. If any exist, use AskUserQuestion to let the user choose between creating new or updating existing.

**2. Write the HTML report**:

Include all analysis data from Phase 4 (feature-architect + security-auditor) and Phase 4.5 (environment fit diagnosis). The report should contain these sections (adapt based on analysis results):

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Identity & Overview** | Plugin name, version, author, description, component inventory chart |
| **Architecture** | Component map diagram — skills, agents, commands, hooks, MCP connections |
| **Feature Deep Dive** | Per-component analysis from feature-architect |
| **Security Audit** | Risk summary, permission matrix, findings from security-auditor |
| **Environment Fit** | Verdict, context budget, overlap, hook impact from Phase 4.5 |
| **Skill Design Quality** | Category distribution, per-skill assessment from feature-architect |
| **Plugin Profile** | Maturity, documentation, quality checklist |
| **Recommendations** | Grouped by priority |

Skip sections with no data (e.g., no security findings → slim security section).

**Diagrams**: Read these reference files for implementation:
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/design-system/mermaid-patterns.md` — Mermaid syntax, theming, dark mode, zoom
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/design-system/semantic-tokens.md` — Color/font roles, Mermaid themeVariables
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/design-system/diagram-type-selection.md` — 13-type selection guide
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/design-system/diagram-density-rules.md` — Complexity budgets

Key diagram rules (always apply):
1. Max 9 nodes, 12 arrows per diagram. Over budget → split
2. 1-2 focal accents only
3. No `rgba()` or `color:` in Mermaid classDef — parser breaks
4. Always `theme: 'base'` with themeVariables from semantic-tokens
5. Architecture diagrams with 15+ components → show 3-5 representatives per layer with total counts, keep under 25 nodes

**CSS essentials**: Write your own CSS inline. Must support:
- `prefers-color-scheme: dark` via CSS custom properties
- Korean font stack (CJK font in font-family)
- `transform: scale()` for Mermaid zoom (not `zoom` property)
- `min-width: 0` on flex/grid children
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Status indicators: colored dots via CSS, no emoji

**Source links**: When `source_type` is `github`, make file paths clickable with `{github_url}/{relative-path}` links. For local sources, use `file://` URLs.

**Content integrity**: All analysis data from sub-agents must survive intact in the report — specific numbers, finding details, risk levels, recommendations. If you're writing "the security audit found issues" instead of listing the actual findings — that's compression.

**3. Validate**: Run artifact-gate after writing:
```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/artifact-gate.js <output-path>
```
If violations found: fix inline, max 2 retries.

**4. Open and present**:
Run `open <output-path>`. Tell the user the report is ready and ask if they want changes.

#### Phase 7: Cleanup

Clean up temporary files:
```
Bash(rm -rf /tmp/plugin-visual-{dirname}-sections)
```

If the source was also cloned from GitHub:
```
Bash(rm -rf /tmp/plugin-visual-{dirname})
```

After cleanup, suggest optional next steps:
- `/fact-check` — verify the report's factual accuracy against the actual codebase
- `/report-manager refine` — refine specific sections based on feedback
- `--verify` — if not used this time, mention that coherence review is available for future runs

This is informational — just a brief suggestion, not an automatic invocation.

### Gotchas

- **GitHub URL analysis requires `gh` CLI**: `gh repo clone` is used for source acquisition from GitHub URLs. If `gh` is not installed or not authenticated, GitHub URL analysis will fail. Local path and installed plugin analysis work without `gh`.
- **`$()` command substitution triggers security prompt**: The `Bash(echo $(date))` pattern causes Claude Code to show a separate permission dialog regardless of `allowed-tools`. Use literal values or `Bash(date)` with separate processing instead.
- **GitHub rate limiting**: `gh repo clone` and `gh api` calls can fail silently with HTTP 403 when the user's token is rate-limited. If clone fails, check `gh auth status` before retrying.
- **Plugin cache has multiple versions**: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` stores every installed version (e.g., `2.6.0/`, `2.7.1/`). Phase 4.5 uses the session context directly (not cache scanning), but if you ever need to inspect the cache manually, always pick the latest version per plugin to avoid counting stale entries.
- **Large plugin batching threshold**: The 15-component threshold for splitting feature-architect is approximate. Plugins with many small commands but few skills may not need splitting, while plugins with 10 dense skills might. Use judgment — the goal is keeping each agent under context limits.
- **Existing report overwrite prompt**: The "create new or update" prompt uses AskUserQuestion. If the user is running non-interactively or in a pipeline, this blocks. Default to "create new" if no user response is available.
- **Temp directory collision**: The 8-char hex `{dirname}` has a negligible collision risk, but if a previous run crashed without cleanup, `/tmp/plugin-visual-*` directories may linger. The cleanup phase handles the current run only — it does not garbage-collect stale dirs.
- **Skill category misclassification**: Skills that span multiple categories (e.g., a deploy skill with review features) should be classified by primary purpose — what the user invokes it for. Don't try to assign multiple categories; pick the best fit and note the overlap in the description.
- **Design quality false negatives**: A skill with no `scripts/` directory isn't necessarily "Basic" — some skills genuinely don't need scripts (pure knowledge/reference skills). Apply the N/A classification for criteria that don't apply to the skill type.
- **New hook events**: The security-auditor knows about 22 hook events as of 2026-03. If new events are added to Claude Code, the event list in `security-rules.md` and `security-auditor.md` may need updating.
- **Plugin agent ignored frontmatter fields**: `permissionMode`, `hooks`, `mcpServers` are silently ignored on plugin agents. The fields `effort`, `model`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `maxTurns`, `skills`, `memory`, `background`, `isolation` work normally. Analysis agents use `effort: high` and inherit the session model.
- **Agent `effort` field**: The `effort` field (low/medium/high/max) is distinct from the `model` field. A Haiku agent with `effort: max` is different from an Opus agent with default effort. Report both when present.
- **Instruction layer analysis false positives**: Step 10 of the security-auditor analyzes SKILL.md body text for adversarial patterns (env var exfiltration, obfuscation, undeclared URLs). Setup/config skills that reference env var names as documentation, API skills with endpoint URLs, and encoding skills with base64 examples will trigger pattern matches. Context Modifiers handle common cases, but review flagged findings carefully — a MEDIUM on a config skill's env var reference is usually informational, not a real threat.
- **Mermaid node labels with special chars**: Node labels containing `:`, `/`, `<`, `>` must be double-quoted in Mermaid code (`C1["gsd:new-project"]` not `C1[gsd:new-project]`). Unquoted special chars cause Mermaid parsing errors.
- **Command-based plugins and empty Skill Design Quality**: Plugins built on `commands/` instead of `skills/` will have empty skill_design_quality data. Adapt analysis for command-based plugins rather than leaving sections empty.
- **Architecture diagrams with large plugins**: Plugins with 15+ components → show 3-5 representatives per architectural layer with total counts, keep under 25 nodes per diagram.
- **Discovery phase must use Glob only, never Bash**: Phase 2 file discovery must use Glob calls exclusively. Bash calls like `ls` or `find` are not in `allowed-tools` and trigger a user permission prompt that blocks execution (observed: 185s wait). All file listing needs are covered by Glob patterns — there is no case where Bash is needed for discovery.
- **Rules with `paths:` frontmatter are deferred**: Rules that have a `paths:` field in frontmatter are NOT always-loaded — they only activate when matching file paths are in context. Treat them as zero always-on cost in context budget analysis. Rules WITHOUT `paths:` load their full content at session start.
- **Plugin settings.json only supports `agent` field**: A plugin's `settings.json` at the root level only supports the `agent` field for setting a default agent. It does NOT support `permissions`, `hooks`, or other settings — these are silently ignored. Don't report unsupported settings as features.
- **Bundle source detection is best-effort**: `skills-lock.json` may not exist in older installations, and cache path patterns can vary. Always fall back to plugin.json `repository` field or mark as `unknown`. Don't report missing provenance as a security issue.
- **Scope impact for marketplace plugins**: All marketplace-installed plugins operate at the global scope. Their hooks fire for every project. If the plugin is highly framework-specific (e.g., React, Django), note this as a scope appropriateness concern — the user may want to conditionally disable it for non-matching projects.
- **Context budget empirical grounding**: Context budget recommendations reference empirical estimates of ~20% structural waste in production sessions (unused tools, duplicates, stale results). Use this as motivation for context-aware recommendations, but note it's a general finding — individual plugin impact varies.
