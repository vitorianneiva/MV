# Environment Fit Diagnosis — Detailed Steps

This reference contains the detailed procedure for Phase 4.5 of the plugin-visual workflow. The orchestrator SKILL.md references this file for the full step-by-step process.

## Step 1: Extract Plugin Characteristics

Extract these from the feature-architect output:

- Plugin name and at-a-glance description (from Plugin Summary)
- Skill names and trigger descriptions (from Functionality Analysis → Skills table)
- Skill description character counts (sum of all description text)
- Skills with `disable-model-invocation: true` (zero always-on context cost)
- Hook events, count, and **types** (command / prompt / agent) (from Hooks table; 0 if no hooks)
- Hooks that return `additionalContext` (if identifiable from hook scripts)
- External requirements (`requirements` code block; empty if none)
- MCP server count (from `.mcp.json` if present)
- Rules count and loading type (rules without `paths:` → always-loaded; with `paths:` → on-demand)
- CLAUDE.md presence and @import directives (trace import chain for context cost estimation)
- Plugin source context (source_type from Phase 1 — local, github, installed)
- Component interaction patterns:
  - Skills with `allowed-tools` containing `Skill(...)` → Skill→Skill dependency
  - Skills with `context: fork` + `agent` referencing non-plugin agents → Skill→External Agent
  - Agent `skills:` field entries not in this plugin → Agent→External Skill
  - Agent `mcpServers:` string references (not inline) → Agent→External MCP
  - Skills with `allowed-tools` containing `mcp__*` patterns → Skill→MCP dependency

## Step 2: Run Environment Scan

```
Bash(node {plugin-root}/scripts/env-fit-scan.js --plugin-name {plugin-name})
```

Where `{plugin-root}` is this plugin's root directory and `{plugin-name}` is from Phase 3. The script merges `enabledPlugins` across all three settings scopes (user → project → local) with later scopes overriding earlier ones, then filters all scan results to only include plugins enabled for the current project context. It outputs JSON with: `install_status`, `installed_plugins` (enabled only), `installed_skills` (with `total_desc_chars`, `disabled_count`), `installed_commands` (with `total_desc_chars`, `disabled_count`), `local_skills` (includes both skills and commands), `hook_inventory` (with `total`, `type_counts`; plugin hooks filtered by enabled), `context_metrics` (with `mcp_servers` from all 3 settings scopes), and `disabled_plugins` (list of explicitly disabled plugin names from merged settings).

If the plugin has external requirements (from Step 1), also check them with simple commands:

| Type | Check pattern | Status values |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| CLI | `which {name} >/dev/null 2>&1` | AVAILABLE / MISSING |
| MCP | `grep -q '"{name}"' ~/.claude/.mcp.json 2>/dev/null` | AVAILABLE / MISSING |
| ENV | `[ -n "${name}" ]` | SET / UNSET |

## Step 3: Six Diagnostic Analyses

### 3A: Installation Status

- `INSTALLED` → `ALREADY_INSTALLED`
- `NOT_INSTALLED` → `NEW`

### 3B: Dependency Check

Build requirements table: `[{name, type, required, status, help}]`.
Determine: READY / PARTIAL / ACTION_NEEDED.
If no requirements block existed → READY.

### 3C: Context Budget Analysis

Calculate the plugin's context footprint using the **always-loaded vs deferred** model. This distinction mirrors how Claude Code actually injects context — some items consume tokens at session start (always-loaded), while others are loaded on-demand (deferred).

> **Research context**: Empirical analysis of production sessions estimates **~20% structural waste** in context windows from unused tools, duplicates, and stale results. The "Lost in the Middle" effect shows that fuller context correlates with lower accuracy on retrieval tasks. This makes context budget awareness critical for plugin recommendations.

#### Always-loaded items (consume tokens at session start)

| Resource | Token cost model | Budget |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Skill/command descriptions | Sum description chars for items WITHOUT `disable-model-invocation: true`. Formatted as `"skill-name": description` in `<available_skills>` XML | 2% of context window (16K chars fallback) |
| Rules (without `paths:`) | Full file content loaded at session start. Rules WITH `paths:` frontmatter are on-demand | Part of instruction context |
| CLAUDE.md files | Full content with `@import` expansion (up to 5 hops). Includes HTML comment stripping | Part of instruction context |
| Agent/command definitions | Full file content for agents and commands | Part of instruction context |
| MCP server config | Server names and metadata (small) | Minimal |

#### Deferred items (loaded on-demand, reserved but not always present)

| Resource | Token cost model | Budget |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| MCP tool schemas | ~90% of MCP tokens. Loaded when tools are needed | 10% of context window |
| Individual memory files | Loaded via `readFileState` on demand | N/A |
| Rules with `paths:` | Only loaded when matching file paths are in context | N/A |
| Skills with `disable-model-invocation: true` | Only loaded when user explicitly invokes | Zero always-on cost |

#### Calculation steps

1. **Skill/command description chars (always-loaded)**:
   Sum description chars for skills AND commands in this plugin that do NOT have `disable-model-invocation: true`. Add to current environment total from `installed_skills.total_desc_chars` + `installed_commands.total_desc_chars` + `local_skills.total_desc_chars`.

   **Budget reference** (source: [official Skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)):
   > "The budget scales dynamically at 2% of the context window, with a fallback of 16,000 characters."
   > Overridable via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable.

   - 200K scenario: ~16,000 chars (2% of 200K tokens × ~4 chars/token ≈ 16K; coincides with the 16K fallback)
   - 1M scenario: ~80,000 chars (2% of 1M tokens × ~4 chars/token ≈ 80K)

2. **Rules context cost (always-loaded)**:
   Count rules in this plugin. Rules WITHOUT `paths:` frontmatter are always-loaded — their full content is injected at session start. Rules WITH `paths:` are on-demand (deferred). Estimate token cost as `file_size_bytes / 4`.

3. **MCP tool surface (deferred, but reserved)**:
   Count MCP servers this plugin adds (from `.mcp.json`). Estimate tokens using heuristic: servers x 25 tools x 200 tokens/tool.
   - Current MCP token estimate: `context_metrics.mcp_servers x 25 x 200`
   - Adding: `new_servers x 25 x 200`
   - 200K scenario: compare projected total against ~20,000 token cap (10% of 200K)
   - 1M scenario: compare projected total against ~100,000 token cap (10% of 1M)

4. **CLAUDE.md @import chain analysis**:
   If the plugin includes a `CLAUDE.md`, trace its `@import` directives (up to 5 hops). Each imported file adds to always-loaded context. Report:
   - Total files in import chain
   - Estimated total token cost of the chain (`total_bytes / 4`)
   - Whether any imports reference files outside the plugin directory (potential security concern)

5. **Hook context injection**: Check if any hooks in this plugin return `additionalContext` or use `type: prompt`/`type: agent`. Note but don't score heavily — these are per-event, not always-on.

6. **Zero-cost skills**: Note how many skills use `disable-model-invocation: true` — these have no always-on context cost and should be highlighted as a positive design choice.

#### Severity determination

Present both 200K and 1M scenarios in the report. For the overall severity, use the scenario matching the **user's current session model** (e.g., Opus 4.6[1M] → 1M scenario, Sonnet/Haiku → 200K scenario). If the model context cannot be determined, default to 200K as fallback.

Context budget severity considers the **cumulative** always-loaded cost (descriptions + rules + CLAUDE.md imports), not just skill descriptions alone.

### 3D: Functional Overlap & Trigger Analysis

Compare the analyzed plugin's skills against all installed/local skill descriptions. For each skill, scan for semantic overlap — considering purpose, trigger phrases, and approach.

Classify each meaningful overlap:

| Classification | Condition | Example |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| DUPLICATE | Same purpose AND same triggers | Two "commit message generator" skills |
| OVERLAP | Similar purpose, partial trigger overlap | Both handle "code review" but different scope |
| COMPLEMENT | Related domain, different purpose | One analyzes PRs, other generates changelogs |
| UPGRADE | Same purpose but analyzed plugin is superior | More features, better design, broader coverage |

For DUPLICATE/OVERLAP findings, assess trigger collision severity:
- **HIGH**: Near-identical descriptions → Claude unpredictably chooses
- **MEDIUM**: Shared keywords but distinguishable intent/scope
- **LOW**: Thematically related but clearly different triggers

### 3E: Hook Impact

- Current hook count (`hook_inventory.total`) + adding → projected total
- Distinguish hook types from `hook_inventory.type_counts`: command/http (lightweight, zero context) vs prompt/agent (LLM call per event)
- Flag: projected hooks > 15 (HIGH), 10-15 (MEDIUM)
- Same-event collisions with existing plugins (informational)

### 3F: Scope Impact Analysis

Analyze how the plugin distributes its configuration across Claude Code's three scope levels and what inheritance implications this creates.

#### Scope hierarchy

| Scope | Location | Inheritance |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/` | Applies to all projects |
| **Workspace** | `{repo}/.claude/` for repos with child projects | Inherited by child projects |
| **Project** | `{repo}/.claude/` (leaf project) or `~/.claude/projects/{encoded-path}/` | Most specific, highest priority |

#### Analysis steps

1. **Determine plugin installation scope**: Plugins install into the global scope (`~/.claude/plugins/`). Check if the plugin's `settings.json` configures MCP servers or permissions that propagate globally.

2. **Identify scope-affecting components**:
   - **Skills**: Always available globally once plugin is enabled (no scope restriction)
   - **Hooks**: Plugin hooks fire globally — check if any should be scope-limited (e.g., hooks specific to a framework)
   - **MCP servers**: Plugin MCP config applies globally — can conflict with project-level MCP configs
   - **Rules**: If the plugin bundles rules, they apply at the plugin's scope level

3. **Detect scope conflicts**:
   - Plugin hooks that overlap with project-level hooks (same event + matcher)
   - Plugin MCP servers that share names with project-level MCP configs
   - Plugin skills that could confuse with project-local skills (name collision)

4. **Assess scope appropriateness**:
   - Is this plugin truly global (useful across all projects)?
   - Would it be better as a project-level configuration?
   - Are there components that should be conditionally activated per-project?

Output: `scope_impact` object with `installation_scope`, `affected_scopes`, `scope_conflicts[]`, and `appropriateness` assessment.

### 3G: Bundle Source Detection

Identify how the plugin was installed to provide provenance context in the report.

#### Detection methods

1. **skills-lock.json**: Claude Code tracks bundle installations in `skills-lock.json`:
   - Project-level (v1): `{repo}/.claude/skills-lock.json`
   - Global (v3): `~/.claude/skills-lock.json`

   Parse the lock file entries — each maps a skill name to its source bundle (marketplace name, version, and publisher).

2. **Plugin cache path**: Inspect the plugin's location in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`:
   - Path contains marketplace identifier → `marketplace` source
   - Path is a symlink → `local` source (development mode)
   - Plugin.json contains `repository` field with `github.com` → `github` source

3. **Fallback heuristic**: If neither lock file nor cache path provides definitive information:
   - Plugin has `repository` URL in plugin.json → likely `github`
   - Plugin is in the current working directory → `local`
   - Otherwise → `unknown`

#### Output

```
bundle_source: {
  type: "marketplace" | "local" | "github" | "unknown",
  identifier: "marketplace-name@publisher" | "/path/to/local" | "github.com/owner/repo"
}
```

### 3H: Component Dependency Analysis

For each cross-plugin reference found in Step 1:
1. Check if the referenced component exists in the user's environment (installed plugins, local skills, MCP servers)
2. Classify as AVAILABLE or MISSING
3. Internal references (within the same plugin) → INTERNAL, skip

Types to check:
- Skill → Skill: `allowed-tools: Skill(plugin:name)` or instruction-based invocation
- Agent → Skill: `skills:` field with non-plugin skill names
- Skill/Agent → MCP: `mcp__server__*` in allowed-tools, or `mcpServers:` string references
- Skill → Agent: `context: fork` + `agent` field referencing external agent

MISSING dependencies → at least CONDITIONAL verdict.

## Step 4: Determine Overall Verdict

Use `references/platforms/claude-code/analysis-criteria.md` (Environment Fit section).

Verdict priority (highest severity wins):

1. Required dependency MISSING/UNSET → at least CONDITIONAL
2. Required dependency MISSING + DUPLICATE overlap → CONFLICTING
3. DUPLICATE skill with HIGH trigger collision → at least REDUNDANT
4. Multiple OVERLAP findings covering > 50% of plugin's skills → at least REDUNDANT
5. Skill description budget exceeded in the user's context scenario → at least CONDITIONAL; exceeded in both 200K and 1M → CONFLICTING
6. MCP tool surface would exceed 10% cap in the user's context scenario → at least CONDITIONAL; exceeded in both → CONFLICTING
7. Cross-plugin component dependency MISSING → at least CONDITIONAL
8. Projected hooks > 15 or hook context injection HIGH → at least CONDITIONAL
9. Scope conflicts: plugin hooks/MCP collide with project-level configs on same event/name → at least CONDITIONAL
10. All clear → RECOMMENDED

## Step 5: Build Diagnosis Data

  verdict: RECOMMENDED | CONDITIONAL | REDUNDANT | CONFLICTING,
